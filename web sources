I explored this example for project guidelines and sql exploration ideas

I borrowed the following lines of code:

node_attribs["id"] = element.attrib["id"]
node_attribs["lat"] =  element.attrib['lat']
node_attribs["lon"] =  element.attrib['lon']
node_attribs["user"] =  element.attrib['user']
node_attribs["uid"] =  element.attrib['uid']
node_attribs["version"] =  element.attrib['version']
node_attribs["changeset"] =  element.attrib['changeset']
node_attribs["timestamp"] =  element.attrib['timestamp']

I was having trouble setting the types for these values and did not understand why my code was not compiling.  After looking at the error, I understand I did not need to set the type, I could just use the string values as-is and let the schema convert the data.  I also made small naming errors (writing lit instead of lat for longitude) which were caught eventually.
