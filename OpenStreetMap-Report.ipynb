The best thing I could do was look it up by the GPS latitude and longitude data and insert that into the value.  The closest match was 13 Center Street.

For instance, Broadway shows up 11 times as a street name but there is no street type.  When I looiked it up on Wikipedia, it said some streets in the Town Common were changed from Broadway to Park Street and Park Avenue.  However, without further clues I would have no idea which streets should be mapped to one or the other.  I'm sure City Hall probably has the historical records but I did not get a chance to go.  This might be worth it for the next user to explore.\n",

For instance the Connecticut River is listed as Connecticut R., but a universal solution wouldn't work there.  If all 'R.' abbreviations were replaced with 'River', it could have unintended consequences.  For instance, the John R. Fausey Elementary School would be changed to the John River Fausey Elementary School.  And while I don't know his middle name, I doubt I'd get that lucky.  There are many opportunities for exploration here."
